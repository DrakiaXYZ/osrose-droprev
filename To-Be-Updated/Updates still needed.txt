Updates for osRose still needed for DevRev
------------------------------------------



1 - Cannot connect to server with current trose.exe (encryption or ??)

2 - Storage changes 4 normal storages and 4 item mall storages.  You need a item mall storage coupon for each of the 4 item mall storages.  Coupon are for 7 days (old one) and 30 days, current one.
 Normal storage is not restricted to filling the one before it, you can place into any of the normal storages till full

3 - Toolbars in client.  There is a ALT bar 1-12 and 3 normal bars (not 4) of 1-12

4 - Costume system now, stats from all armors do not carry to the character, BUT, if a item mall item that has with a complete set like exp, drops, etc those carry to the character, no matter if in costume slow or normal slot.  NO stats carry over from the armors in costumes.

5 - Trade chat now works.  It will cover the entire map, not like shout or normal chat

6 - Check new GO command (which is now SQL) to make sure it works correctly

7 - Item Mall is now directly in client, need a sql file to allow it to work with client??  Item list, how to purchase points, etc.

8 - New Lucky spin is also tied with the new Item Mall in the client.  Need to see how to add as well, SQL file? Etc! 3 new STB's for this one - LIST_LUCKYSPIN.STB, LIST_LUCKYSPIN_CATEGORY.STB, LIST_LUCKYSPIN_KNOCKOUT.STB

9 - New STB (LIST_ZONE_BLOCKUSEITEM.STB) for blocking certain useitems in certain zones.  Scrolls aren't used in PVP zones, other things might be as well



MORE TO ADD as we remember what has changed since last version that was worked on.
